#Drag'n drop example with rxjs

TL;DR: [live demo via rawgit](https://rawgit.com/filipbech/rxjs-drag-demo/master/index.html)

I watched a brilliant video from netflix javascript talks, and thought I would build out one of the examples. It turned out so easy and awesome, that I got all exited, and thought the world should know...

If anybody really knows rxjs and thinks im messing something up, please file an issue, or make a PR... I'm happy to learn!
